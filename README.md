# SMS Spam Detection using NLP & Naive Bayes

This project implements an **end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline** to classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**. The model is trained and evaluated on the **UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset**, a widely used benchmark dataset for text classification tasks.
